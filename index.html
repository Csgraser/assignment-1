		<p>My name is Casey Graser. I was born in Salt Lake City. I love gaming and outdoor activities. I got into coding due to my
			passion for gaming and I hope that it can land me a terrific career. It has been my dream for a very long time to own
			a home. I hope to accomplish that goal within the next few years by working very hard, and learning to code. I hope to
			work for a company called "Clearlink" some day. I have friends that work their and tell me that it is a wonderful place
			company to work for.
